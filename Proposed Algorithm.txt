PROPOSED ALGORITHM:
It is the need of the hour that SLAAC phase should take as small time as possible. This is because in the present day networks, devices 
constantly get added and migrate to different networks very often. Here we propose an algorithm which satisfies this need without the 
overhead of cryptographic key generation. Let's have a look into the algorithm, the details of securing the DAD process, and mitigating 
DoS attacks during duplicate address detection process when we use stateless address autoconfiguration (SLACC) for configuring the IPv6 
address. During the DAD process in this algorithm, we have two processes that have to be performed: one at the node which sends the NS message, 
and the second process at the receiver nodes which sends the NA message if the address matches it or else it simply discards it.

ACRONYMS USED:
NC=Number of collisions
UF=Uniqueness Flag
NS_C=Neighbour Solicitation collisions
RaN0=64 bit random number
CT= Clock time or the time at the generation
I_ID= Interface Identifier of the IPv6 link local address
LLA= Link Local Address
IP_  T_I_ID=Interface Identifier in the target IP header field
LLA_R_IP=Received link local address
IID_RT=Received target interface Identifier in the target IP field.

At the sender node:

1) Initially set the values as NC=0, NS_C=0, UF=1, CT..
2) Now generate a 64 bit random number and assign it to RaNo.
3) Apply SHA-1 to the concatenation of (NC, NS_C, CT and RaNo) and take the result to Hash-1.
4) Now break the hashed result which is in SHA-512 into two equal parts and put in Div_hash1 and Div_hash2.
5) Now form the interface id (I_ID), by taking 20MSB of Div_hash1 and Div_hash2 and 24 LSB of the generated RaNo at the 2 step.
6)	Now the interface Id (I_ID)is generated , lets combine it with the network prefix part which is given to us. For this LLA address, we have to perform the DAD process.
7) Now perform SHA-512 on the interface id (I_ID) and take the result into Hash-2.
8) Now we have to form the IP_T_I_ID for the icmpv6 header field target ip address by taking 40 MSB of SHA-512 and 24 LSB of the generated link-local address. 
9) Now for the target IP address field in icmpv6 header is formed by concatenating the local network prefix with IP_T_I_ID to form a 128 bit address.
10) Now we have to perform the DAD process on the generated link local address whether it is unique or not by sending a Neighbor Solicitation (NS) message.

Now an ICMPv6 type 134 message is sent with the source address as unspecified address and destination address as solicited node multicast address FE80::1. 

11) The source node will receive an NS message for the same LLA whenever a rogue node is trying to perform the DAD process for the same LLA, by this he can carry out the DAD process. 
Each time this happens the collision count is increased by 1. If the value equals 5 it means that an attack is being carried out by any rouge node.
